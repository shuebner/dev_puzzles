# Puzzles for software developers

This will become a collection of puzzles regarding programming and the tooling around it.

# How to participate

Simple:

1. Note the [Prerequisites](#Prerequisites).
2. Select a puzzle to solve
3. Read the instructions
4. Resist the urge to look at the solution
5. Solve it or give up ;-)
6. Finally check the solution

# Repo Structure

Each puzzle has its own numbered folder and within that folder two subfolders.

The `Puzzle` folder contains the files that comprise the puzzle.
The files may contain explanatory comments.
There may additionally be an explaining README.


The `Solution` folder contains the solution to the puzzle.
Usually it will be a modified version of the `Puzzle` folder.
The files may contain explanatory comments.
There may additionally be an explaining README.
You can of course use diff tools to see the exact changes that lead to the solution.

# Prerequisites

I assume that a lot of puzzles will be C#-based.
You should have .NET SDK 6 or above installed along with the editor/IDE of your choice.

Some puzzles may require you to use additional tooling.
This will be mentioned in the puzzle explanation.
For some puzzles, discovering and using the right tools may be part of the solution and thus not mentioned in the puzzle.
