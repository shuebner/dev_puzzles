The method on `Source` must take as its argument an interface with a callback method that is generic over `T`, accepting an argument of type `Source<T>`.
The method's implementation in `Source<T>` calls the interface method with `this` as its argument, thus providing both the type argument `T` and a way to get at the `Value` later.
This establishes a [visitor pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern) over `Source<T>`.
