# Solution

Code inserted at the marked spot:
```csharp
yield break;
```
# Explanation

Because of `yield`, the method will return a lazily evaluated `IEnumerable<int>` with a compiler-generated `Enumerator`.
The exception is no longer thrown upon method call.
The exception will be thrown only upon iteration of the returned `IEnumerable`.

Note the additional test method to demonstrate.
Debug to see the lazy enumeration.

Also note how the code is flagged as unreachable ([CS0162](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/misc/cs0162)).
That is true.
The code is still essential for the desired runtime behavior, not because it is executed, but because it triggers the compiler to emit different IL code.
